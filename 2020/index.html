<p>First, it is unclear whether you actually need to be very familiar with all of these topics since they are very low level topics.
They will matter as you start writing more low level code like implementing or modifying a kernel. Otherwise, most topics will not be relevant, with the exception of processes and signals that were briefly covered in other lectures.</p></p>

<h2 id="keyboard-remapping">Keyboard remapping</h2>
<p>As a programmer, your keyboard is your main input method. As with pretty much anything in your computer, it is configurable (and worth configuring).</p>
<p>The most basic change is to remap keys.
This usually involves some software that is listening and, whenever a certain key is pressed, it intercepts that event and replaces it with another event corresponding to a different key. Some examples:</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/security/">Security and Cryptography</a></h2>
      <p><p>Last year&rsquo;s <a href="/2019/security/">security and privacy lecture</a> focused on how you
can be more secure as a computer <em>user</em>. This year, we will focus on security
and cryptography concepts that are relevant in understanding tools covered
earlier in this class, such as the use of hash functions in Git or key
derivation functions and symmetric/asymmetric cryptosystems in SSH.</p>
<p>This lecture is not a substitute for a more rigorous and complete course on
computer systems security (<a href="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/">6.858</a>) or
cryptography (<a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/">6.857</a> and 6.875). Don&rsquo;t
do security work without formal training in security. Unless you&rsquo;re an expert,
don&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/05/amateurs_produc.html">roll your own
crypto</a>.
The same principle applies to systems security.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/metaprogramming/">Metaprogramming</a></h2>
      <p><p>What do we mean by &ldquo;metaprogramming&rdquo;? Well, it was the best collective
term we could come up with for the set of things that are more about
<em>process</em> than they are about writing code or working more efficiently.
In this lecture, we will look at systems for building and testing your
code, and for managing dependencies. These may seem like they are of
limited importance in your day-to-day as a student, but the moment you
interact with a larger code base through an internship or once you enter
the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, you will see this everywhere. We should note that
&ldquo;metaprogramming&rdquo; can also mean &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">programs that operate on
programs</a>&rdquo;, whereas that
is not quite the definition we are using for the purposes of this
lecture.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/debugging-profiling/">Debugging and Profiling</a></h2>
      <p><p>A golden rule in programming is that code does not do what you expect it to do, but what you tell it to do.
Bridging that gap can sometimes be a quite difficult feat.
In this lecture we are going to cover useful techniques for dealing with buggy and resource hungry code: debugging and profiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements&rdquo; â€” Brian Kernighan, <em>Unix for Beginners</em>.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/version-control/">Version Control (Git)</a></h2>
      <p><p>Version control systems (VCSs) are tools used to track changes to source code
(or other collections of files and folders). As the name implies, these tools
help maintain a history of changes; furthermore, they facilitate collaboration.
VCSs track changes to a folder and its contents in a series of snapshots, where
each snapshot encapsulates the entire state of files/folders within a top-level
directory. VCSs also maintain metadata like who created each snapshot, messages
associated with each snapshot, and so on.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/command-line/">Command-line Environment</a></h2>
      <p><p>In this lecture we will go through several ways in which you can improve your workflow when using the shell. We have been working with the shell for a while now, but we have mainly focused on executing different commands. We will now see how to run several processes at the same time while keeping track of them, how to stop or pause a specific process and how to make a process run in the background.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/data-wrangling/">Data Wrangling</a></h2>
      <p><p>Have you ever wanted to take data in one format and turn it into a
different format? Of course you have! That, in very general terms, is
what this lecture is all about. Specifically, massaging data, whether in
text or binary format, until you end up with exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen some basic data wrangling in past lectures. Pretty
much any time you use the <code>|</code> operator, you are performing some kind of
data wrangling. Consider a command like <code>journalctl | grep -i intel</code>. It
finds all system log entries that mention Intel (case insensitive). You
may not think of it as wrangling data, but it is going from one format
(your entire system log) to a format that is more useful to you (just
the intel log entries). Most data wrangling is about knowing what tools
you have at your disposal, and how to combine them.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/editors/">Editors (Vim)</a></h2>
      <p><p>Writing English words and writing code are very different activities. When
programming, you spend more time switching files, reading, navigating, and
editing code compared to writing a long stream. It makes sense that there are
different types of programs for writing English words versus code (e.g.
Microsoft Word versus Visual Studio Code).</p>
<p>As programmers, we spend most of our time editing code, so it&rsquo;s worth investing
time mastering an editor that fits your needs. Here&rsquo;s how you learn a new
editor:</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/shell-tools/">Shell Tools and Scripting</a></h2>
      <p><p>In this lecture, we will present some of the basics of using bash as a scripting language along with a number of shell tools that cover several of the most common tasks that you will be constantly performing in the command line.</p>
<h1 id="shell-scripting">Shell Scripting</h1>
<p>So far we have seen how to execute commands in the shell and pipe them together.
However, in many scenarios you will want to perform a series of commands and make use of control flow expressions like conditionals or loops.</p></p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/course-shell/">Course overview &#43; the shell</a></h2>
      <p><h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>As computer scientists, we know that computers are great at aiding in
repetitive tasks. However, far too often, we forget that this applies
just as much to our <em>use</em> of the computer as it does to the computations
we want our programs to perform. We have a vast range of tools
available at our fingertips that enable us to be more productive and
solve more complex problems when working on any computer-related
problem. Yet many of us utilize only a small fraction of those tools; we
only know enough magical incantations by rote to get by, and blindly
copy-paste commands from the internet when we get stuck.</p></p>
